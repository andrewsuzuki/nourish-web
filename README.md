# nourish-web

Web app for UConn Nourish. Built using Gulp, AngularJS, and Browserify.

This app is a completely static front end for the Nourish API, found below in the links section (nourish-server).

When deployed using `gulp deploy`, the build (generated in /build) is pushed to the gh-pages branch. Since it's all static, it works just fine through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
